# Ecommerce-Data-Analysis
This project explores an E-Commerce dataset from Kaggle, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights that can drive business decisions. The dataset consists of online transactions from a UK-based retailer, and this analysis helps in understanding customer behavior, revenue patterns, product demand, and operational inefficiencies.

Project Objectives:

    Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
        Handling missing values and removing redundant columns.
        Filtering out anomalies like negative quantities (returns).
        Creating new features such as Total Price, Hour, Day, and Month for deeper analysis.
        Ensuring proper data types, including datetime conversion.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        Understanding Price & Quantity Distribution: Identifying outliers and general purchasing trends.
        Correlation Analysis: Evaluating relationships between numerical features like unit price, total price, and quantity.
        Country-Wise Insights: Identifying the top markets based on transaction volume.
        Revenue Trends: Analyzing revenue distribution by hour of the day and month of the year.

    Business-Centric Insights
        Top Revenue-Generating Countries (excluding the UK) for potential market expansion.
        Frequent Product Pairings to assist in cross-selling and bundling strategies.
        Peak Sales Hours to optimize marketing and inventory planning.
        Top High-Value Customers for designing loyalty programs.
        Product Returns Analysis to reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction.

Visualizations & Key Findings:

    Distribution of Unit Prices & Quantities: Most products are priced under $100, but certain high-priced items require further investigation.
    Top Countries by Transactions: The UK dominates, but other key markets can be leveraged for expansion.
    Revenue Trends by Hour & Month: Sales peak at specific hours, helping optimize marketing and promotions.
    Frequent Product Bundles: Identifying commonly bought-together items for strategic promotions.
    Return Analysis: Detecting products with high return rates to address quality or expectation mismatches.

Tools & Technologies Used:

    Python: Data processing and analysis.
    Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and transformation.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
    Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data exploration.

Conclusion:

This project provides actionable insights into customer behavior, revenue drivers, and operational improvements. The findings can guide business strategies, such as targeted marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
